# scaffold_assemblies
## Oct 10 2024

A designed to automate and visualize alignments between genomes. Uses RagTag to generate initial alignments.

Status: Script is tested on Nietzsche. RagTag does not activate due to missing minimap2.

### Next objectives (scripting): 
1. Get RagTag to work on Nietzsche (install minimap2 from source) - test
2. run the dotplot visualization. figure out how to recreate the R dotplots and not have them look like shit
3. Figure out a copycat NCBI visualization
4. Figure out a Circos plot

### Next objectives (bioinformatics):
1. Load renamed genomes to the OVH. run ragtag and pull back down for visualizing.
